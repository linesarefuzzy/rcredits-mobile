## Features

- Adds full IndexedDB support to any web browser that [supports WebSql](http://caniuse.com/#search=websql)
- Does nothing if the browser already [natively supports IndexedDB](http://caniuse.com/#search=indexeddb)
- Can _optionally replace_ native IndexedDB on browsers with [buggy implementations](http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/09/25/IndexedDB-on-iOS-8-Broken-Bad/)
- Can _optionally enhance_ native IndexedDB on browsers that are [missing certain features](http://codepen.io/cemerick/pen/Itymi)
- Works on __desktop__ and __mobile__ devices
- Works on __Cordova__ and __PhoneGap__ via the [IndexedDB plug-in](http://plugins.cordova.io/#/package/com.msopentech.websql)
- This shim is basically an IndexedDB-to-WebSql adapter.
- Can be used in Node (courtesy of [websql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websql)
    which sits on top of SQLite3)
- More details about the project at [gh-pages](http://nparashuram.com/IndexedDBShim)

## Installation

You can download the [development](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/master/dist/indexeddbshim.js) or [production (minified)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/master/dist/indexeddbshim.min.js) script, or install it using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) or [Bower](http://bower.io/).

### Node

```bash
npm install indexeddbshim
```

To set up:

```js
const setGlobalVars = require('indexeddbshim');
// This function defines `shimIndexedDB`, `indexedDB`, `IDBFactory`, etc. on
//  one of the following objects in order of precedence:
// 1. A passed in object
// 2. `window` (for Node, define `GLOBAL.window = GLOBAL;`)
// 3. A new object
GLOBAL.window = GLOBAL; // We'll allow ourselves to use `window.indexedDB` or `indexedDB` as a global
setGlobalVars();
```

### Bower

````bash
bower install IndexedDBShim
````

### Cloning the repository

If you clone the repository to work against an unstable version, you only
need to clone the repository recursively if you wish to have the W3C tests
available for testing (which unfortunately loads all W3C tests into the
"web-platform-tests" subdirectory rather than just the IndexedDB ones).

## Using the polyfill

Add the script to your page

```html
<script src="dist/indexeddbshim.min.js"></script>
```

If the browser already natively supports IndexedDB, then the script won't do
anything.  Otherwise, it'll add the [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
to the browser.  Either way, you can use IndexedDB just like normal.
[Here's an example](https://gist.github.com/BigstickCarpet/a0d6389a5d0e3a24814b)

## Fixing Problems in Native IndexedDB

Even if a browser natively supports IndexedDB, you may still want to use this
shim.  Some native IndexedDB implemenatations are [very buggy](http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/9/25/IndexedDB-on-iOS-8--Broken-Bad).
Others are [missing certain features](http://codepen.io/cemerick/pen/Itymi).
There are also many minor inconsistencies between different browser
implementations of IndexedDB, such as how errors are handled, how transaction
timing works, how records are sorted, how cursors behave, etc.  Using this
shim will ensure consistent behavior across all browsers.

To force IndexedDBShim to shim the browser's native IndexedDB, add this
line to your script:

```javascript
window.shimIndexedDB.__useShim()
```

On browsers that support WebSQL, this line will _completely replace_ the
native IndexedDB implementation with the IndexedDBShim-to-WebSQL
implementation.

On browsers that _don't_ support WebSQL, but _do_ support IndexedDB, this
line will patch many known problems and add missing features.  For example,
on Internet Explorer, this will add support for compound keys.

## Debugging

The IndexedDB polyfill has sourcemaps enabled, so the polyfill can be debugged
even if the minified file is included.

To print out detailed debug messages, add this line to your script:

```javascript
window.shimIndexedDB.__debug(true);
```

## Configuration

Rather than using globals, a method has been provided to share state across
IndexedDBShim modules.

Its signature for setting configuration:

```js
shimIndexedDB.__setConfig(property, value);
```

...and for retrieving:

```js
shimIndexedDB.__getConfig(property);
```

The available properties are:

- __DEBUG__ - Boolean (equivalent to calling `shimIndexedDB.__debug(val)`)
- __cursorPreloadPackSize__ - Number indicating how many records to preload for
    caching of (non-multiEntry) `IDBCursor.continue` calls. Defaults to 100.
- __win__,  Object on which there may be an `openDatabase` method (if any)
    for WebSQL; Defaults to `window` or `self` in the browser and for Node,
    it is set by default to [`node-websql`](https://github.com/nolanlawson/node-websql).
- __UnicodeIDStart__ and __UnicodeIDContinue__ - Invocation of
    `createObjectStore` and `createIndex` calls for validation of key paths.
    The specification technically allows all [`IdentifierName`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#prod-IdentifierName)
    strings, but as this requires a [very large regular expression](https://gist.github.com/brettz9/b4cd6821d990daa023b2e604de371407),
    it is replaced by default with `[$A-Z_a-z]` and `[$0-9A-Z_a-z]`,
    respectively. Note that these are and must be expressed as strings,
    not `RegExp` objects. You can use this configuration to change the default
    to match the spec or as you see fit. In the future we may allow the spec
    behavior via optional dynamic loading of an internal module.
- __DEFAULT_DB_SIZE__ - Used as estimated size argument (in bytes) to
    underlying WebSQL `openDatabase` calls. Defaults to `4 * 1024 * 1024` or
    `25 * 1024 * 1024` in Safari (apparently necessary due to Safari creating
    larger files and possibly also due to Safari not completing the storage
    of all records even after permission is given). Has no effect in Node (using [`node-websql`](https://github.com/nolanlawson/node-websql)),
    and its use in WebSQL-compliant browsers is implementation dependent (the
    browser may use this information to suggest the use of this quota to the
    user rather than prompting the user regularly for say incremental 5MB
    permissions).

## Known Issues

All code has bugs, and this project is no exception.  If you find a bug,
please [let us know about it](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/issues).
Or better yet, [send us a fix](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/pulls)!
Please make sure someone else hasn't already reported the same bug though.

Here is a summary of known issues to resolve:

1. Support versionchange rollbacks
2. `close` and `blocked` event support (reconcile with existing `versionchange`)
3. `eval` is currently in use (in `src/Sca.js`)
4. Add new Binary/ArrayBuffer/Views on buffers (TypedArray or DataView) support
5. Support cyclic objects (via Structured Cloning Algorithm)
6. Certain more recent APIs are missing: `IDBCursor.continuePrimaryKey`,
    `IDBIndex` (`getAll`, `getAllKeys`), `IDBObjectStore` (`getAll`,
    `getAllKeys`, `getKey`).

There are a few bugs that are outside of our power to fix.  Namely:

### iOS

Due to a [bug in WebKit](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137034), the
`window.indexedDB` property is read-only and cannot be overridden by
IndexedDBShim.  There are two possible workarounds for this:

1. Use `window.shimIndexedDB` instead of `window.indexedDB`
2. Create an `indexedDB` variable in your closure

By creating a variable named `indexedDB`, all the code within that closure
will use the variable instead of the `window.indexedDB` property.  For example:

```javascript
(function() {
    // This works on all browsers, and only uses IndexedDBShim as a final fallback
    var indexedDB = window.indexedDB || window.mozIndexedDB || window.webkitIndexedDB || window.msIndexedDB || window.shimIndexedDB;

    // This code will use the native IndexedDB, if it exists, or the shim otherwise
    indexedDB.open("MyDatabase", 1);
})();
```

#### Windows Phone

IndexedDBShim works on Windows Phone via a Cordova/PhoneGap plug-in.  There
are two plugins available: [cordova-plugin-indexedDB](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/cordova-plugin-indexedDB)
and [cordova-plugin-indexeddb-async](https://github.com/ABB-Austin/cordova-plugin-indexeddb-async).
Both plug-ins rely on a WebSQL-to-SQLite adapter, but there are differences
in their implementations.  Try them both and see which one works best for
your app.

## Building

To build the project locally on your computer:

1. __Clone this repo__
`git clone https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim.git`

2. __Install dev dependencies__
`npm install`

3. __Run the build script__
`npm start`

4. __Done__

The output files will be generated in the `dist` directory

## Testing

There are currently three folders for tests, `tests-qunit`,
`tests-mocha` and `tests-polyfill` (the latter are also Mocha-based
tests, but at present [only work in Node](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/issues/249)).

They can be run through a variety of means as described below.

To properly build the files (lint, browserify, and minify), use `npm start`
or to also keep a web server, run `npm run dev` (or `grunt dev`).

The tests produce various database files. These are avoided in
`.gitignore` and should be cleaned up if the tests pass, but if
you wish to delete them all manually, run `npm run clean`.

### Browser testing

All QUnit-based tests should pass in modern browsers.

All Mocha-based browser tests should pass except for one test having
a [problem in Firefox](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/issues/250).

#### Automated browser unit testing

Follow all of the steps above to build the project, then run `npm test`
or `npm run sauce-qunit` (or `npm run phantom-qunit` or
`grunt phantom-qunit` to avoid using Saucelabs when you have
credentials set up as environmental variables) to run the unit tests.

Note that when not running Saucelabs, the tests are run in
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), which is a headless WebKit browser.

The older PhantomJS version has problems with two tests, however:
`index.openCursor(range)` and
`IDBObjectStore.openKeyCursor` due apparently to
a bug with the WebKit browser used in the older PhantomJS implementation
(but the tests themselves report as having such problems).

#### Manual browser testing

If you want to run the tests in a normal web browser, you'll need to
spin-up a local web server and then open [`tests-qunit/index.html?noglobals`](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/blob/master/tests-qunit/index.html?noglobals)
and/or [`tests-mocha/index.html`](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/blob/master/tests-mocha/index.html)
in your browser. You can also run `npm run dev` and point your
browser to `http://localhost:9999/tests-qunit/index.html` or
`http://localhost:9999/tests-mocha/index.html`.

Note that, for the Mocha tests, you probably wish to
"Switch to IndexedDBShim" when doing
the testing since otherwise, it will only test the native implementation.

### Node Testing

To run the Node tests, run the following:

1. `npm run node-qunit` - The full test suite sometimes
    [does not complete execution](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/issues/251).
2. `npm run mocha`
3. `npm run tests-polyfill` (or its components `npm run fake`,
    `npm run mock`). Note that none of these are currently
    passing in full, however. You can run `npm run good` to see the
    ones which ought to remain passing.
4. `npm run w3c` (you must first run
    `git submodule update --init --recursive` if you have not already
    recursively cloned the repository). Note that some of these tests
    may not be passing because of the test environment not being
    completely configured for Node. We are working on fixing this.
    There are some older and less complete W3C tests that can be run
    with `npm run w3c-old`, but the goal is to remove these once
    the new ones are configured properly.

To run a specific Mocha test (which includes the `tests-polyfill`
tests), run `npm --test=... run mocha`.

### Testing in a Cordova/PhoneGap app

If you want to run the tests in a Cordova or PhoneGap app, then you'll need
to create a new Cordova/PhoneGap project, and add the
[IndexedDB plug-in](http://plugins.cordova.io/#/package/com.msopentech.indexeddb).
Then copy the contents of our [`tests`](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/tree/master/tests)
directory into your project's `www` directory.   Delete our
[`index.html`](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/blob/master/tests/index.html)
file and rename [`cordova.html`](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/blob/master/tests/cordova.html)
to `index.html`.
